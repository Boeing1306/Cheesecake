# Cheesecake
This is step by step on how to make cheesecake. 

Firstly, you must keep the 250g packets of cream cheese outside of your fridge to soften up. If you are in a rush, you can just put them inside your microwave. While you are doing this or prepping your ingredients, preheat an oven to about 325 degrees farenheit. 

Secondly, once you have all the ingredients prepped and portioned, you can start making the cheesecake. In a standmixer or a bowl with a handmixer, whip up all the cream cheese until soft. Next, add the sugar, vanilla, flour, and eggs once at a time. Once this is complete, keep mixing until all ingredients are incorporated. 

Thirdly, once all your ingredients are mixed well and ready to bake, place in a baking pan without paper or that is not greased. Pour in the cheesecake mixture and bake for about 1 hour to an hour and 10 minutes. Do not poke the cheesecake to check for doneness as it will crumble! Once it is baked, run a knife around the edge to loosen the cake before removing the rim.

Finally, Refrigerate for about 4 hours, or whenever you're ready to eat it. You can create a jam or compote to go on top, which is quite easy. Just cook some fresh or frozen fruits in a saucepan, and gradually add little bits of sugar for some sweetness. Although, this is optional and you can create much more.
